We prove that the set of DES permutations (encryption and decryption for each DES key) is not
closed under functional composition. This implies that, in general, multiple DES-encryption is
not equivalent to single DES-encryption, and that DES is not susceptible to a particular known-
plaintext attack which requires, on average, 2 ^ 28 steps. We also show that the size of the subgroup
generated by the set of DES permutations is greater than 10 ^ 2499 , which is too large for potential
attacks on DES which would exploit a small subgroup.
